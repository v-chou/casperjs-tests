IN PARTICULAR, THE CONFLUENCE OF DIVERSE TECHNOLOGIES HAS ENABLED A REVOLUTION IN MEDICAL APPLICATIONS OF ROBOTIC TECHNOLOGIES TOWARD IMPROVING HEALTH CARE. WHEREAS INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS WERE DEVELOPED PRIMARILY TO AUTOMATE ROUTINE AND DANGEROUS MACROSCALE MANUFACTURING TASKS, MEDICAL ROBOTIC DEVICES ARE DESIGNED FOR ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTS AND OPERATIONS RELEVANT TO THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF DISEASES. THEREFORE, UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL "OLD" ROBOTS, WHICH ARE BUILT WITH LARGE MECHANICAL SYSTEMS, MEDICAL ROBOTS REQUIRE MINIATURIZED PARTS AND SMART MATERIALS FOR COMPLEX AND PRECISE OPERATIONS AND MATING WITH THE HUMAN BODY. THE RAPID GROWTH IN MEDICAL ROBOTICS HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN MOTORS, CONTROL THEORY, MATERIALS, AND MEDICAL IMAGING AND INCREASE IN SURGEON/PATIENT ACCEPTANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, ROBOTIC SURGICAL SYSTEMS, SUCH AS THE DA VINCI SYSTEM, ALLOW TRANSLATION OF THE SURGEON\'S hand movements into smaller, precise movements of tiny instruments within the patient\'s body. Despite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery, there are still major technical difficulties and challenges. In particular, the mechanical parts of existing medical robotic devices are still relatively large and rigid to access and treat major previously inaccessible parts of the human body. Designing miniaturized and versatile robots of a few micrometers or less would allow access throughout the whole human body, leading to new procedures down to the cellular level and offering localized diagnosis and treatment with greater precision and efficiency.
